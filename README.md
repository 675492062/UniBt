## What is UniBt?
UniRx is behavior trees structure based open source([MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)) asset that has been re-implemented in UE4 behavior trees style to suit the Unity environment.
The "standard" behavior trees are good but every frames must be a lot of work and it is complex due to the need to create a number of nodes to confirm the condition.
This library is pursuing a behavior trees structure of UE4 to solve such problems.
